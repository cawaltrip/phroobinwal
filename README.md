Website and deployment for design site.

## Our Ethos
At the core of us on this project is the belief that equality is for everyone and not just some, that agency is unalienable, and that each person should have safe outlets available.
You don't have to share in our values to use our code - that's why we're using the license we are.
If you do interact with this repository (e.g., via issues) we do expect some basic decency.
That means no hate speech or harassment.
That means respecting an individual's pronouns.
That means acting with compassion, not making assumptions, and working constructively with others.
Just be good people! 🤘🏼

And please help hold us to these same standards!
